## Notes for the Workshop

Thanks very much to Steve Pietrek for an awesome workshop : )

The slide deck has been added to the repo.

The presentation notes to follow along have been updated and are in the repo. 

Code files for the workshop are available here:

1.	workshop.reactjs.1 > Part 2 > https://github.com/spietrek/workshop.reactjs.1
2.	workshop.reactjs.2 > Part 3 > https://github.com/spietrek/workshop.reactjs.2

I would highly suggest checking out the rest of Steve's github for some more to learn from on lots of front-end technologies.
You can also follow him on Twitter (https://twitter.com/spietrek). He shares a lot of awesome resources!

Thanks everyone for coming!
